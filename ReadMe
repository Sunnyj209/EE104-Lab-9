--- Pygame Dance Challenge ---


Certainly! Here's a sample README file based on the code you provided:

---------Game--------------
This is a two-player Dance Challenge game implemented using Python and the Pygame library. The players take turns matching the dance moves displayed on the screen to score points. The game features a countdown, dance moves display, and player scores.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pygame library
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dance-dance-revolution.git
Install the Pygame library:
Copy code
pip install pygame
Usage
Run the game:

python main.py
Gameplay:
Player 1 controls:
Dance moves: W, A, S, D
Player 2 controls:
Dance moves: Up Arrow, Left Arrow, Down Arrow, Right Arrow
Gameplay Rules:
Each player takes turns matching the displayed dance moves.
When a dance move is displayed, the corresponding player must press the correct key to perform the move.
If a player presses the correct key, their score increases by 1.
If a player presses the wrong key, the game ends.
After each turn, the game generates a new set of dance moves to be displayed.

Loan Data Scatter Plot
This script generates a scatter plot to visualize the relationships between various features in a loan dataset. It uses the seaborn library in Python to create the scatter plot.

Requirements
Python 3.x
seaborn library
pandas library
matplotlib library
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-data-scatter-plot.git
Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install seaborn pandas matplotlib
Usage
Prepare the dataset:

Make sure you have a CSV file named "loan_data_with_risk_categories.csv" containing the loan data.
The dataset should include the following columns: 'LOAN', 'MORTDUE', 'VALUE', 'YOJ', 'DEROG', 'DELINQ', 'CLAGE', 'NINQ', 'CLNO', 'DEBTINC', and 'risk_category'.
Run the script:

Copy code
python scatter_plot.py
Output:
The script will generate a scatter plot showing the relationships between the loan features.
Each point on the scatter plot represents a loan, and the color represents the risk category of the loan.
Screenshots
Include relevant screenshots or GIFs showcasing the scatter plot here.

--- Covid Trend Prediction ---
COVID-19 Case Prediction
This script performs a linear regression analysis on COVID-19 case count data to predict the number of cases for the next 3 months. It uses the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn libraries in Python.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas library
numpy library
matplotlib library
scikit-learn library
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid-case-prediction.git
Install the required libraries:
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Prepare the dataset:

Make sure you have a CSV file named "COVID-19_case_counts_by_date.csv" containing the COVID-19 case count data.
The dataset should include the following columns: 'Date' (in the format '%m/%d/%Y') and 'Total_cases'.
Run the script:

Copy code
python covid_case_prediction.py
Output:
The script will perform a linear regression analysis on the COVID-19 case count data.
It will plot the actual case counts for the first 3 months, the predicted case counts for the next 3 months, and the overall actual case counts for the full 6 months.
Screenshots
Include relevant screenshots or GIFs showcasing the plot generated by the script here.
